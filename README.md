# Description
CallandRespond_RL is a music-based learning program that attempts to mimic the call-and-response technique.
- In music, one player offers a phrase that the second player then builds off of and provides unique commentary to. The primary objective is for both musicians to work together to help move the song along in a way that is both creative and cohesive.
# How to Use
**Important**
- Prior to running the code, it is best to ensure you have the proper configurations set up. 
- In our program, we've utilized the Python-based toolkit **Music21** from MIT to help generate and compose our musical examples. 
  - [More information can be found through their documentation website.](http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/index.html)
- This toolkit is compatible with music notation software such as [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/), [Finale](https://www.finalemusic.com/), and [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en). To be able to display the results of our program, we recommend you download one of these three options (we've personally used MuseScore).
